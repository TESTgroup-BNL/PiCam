## Backgound
PiCAM is a custom-grade phenocam system designed by the [Terrestrial Ecosystem Science & Technology group](https://www.bnl.gov/envsci/testgroup/) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The PiCAM has the advantage of being compact, low power cost, and lightweight, partially suitable for Arctic environments. It was desinged to operate for at least a fiscal year (6 images per day) with three AA lithium batteries. Given its compact and light-weight feature, PiCAM can be deployed on small hosts (e.g., stakes), addressing the challenges of deploying heavy infrastructure commonly needed for commercial phenocams.
#### Below, we describe the parts, assemble, and basic operation of PiCAMs. Please also refer to XXX for more detailed technical description of the PiCAM and example applications in Arctic field sites.
